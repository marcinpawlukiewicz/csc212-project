# CSC 212 Final Project Sorting Algorithms

## Sorting Algorithms Benchmarked

The Sorting Algorithms Benchmarked is a program that allows users to compare the total amount of time, different sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, and counting sort required to sort input arrays in ascending orders. The input arrays that the program would test range from a sorted, partially sorted, random, and reverse array to test how different input arrays would make the different sorting algorithms behave relative to time. Furthermore, the user would select from a range of sizes that they would like the input arrays to be. Finally, the Sorting Algorithm Benchmarked will provide the user with the option of a user interface that would graph the data with all four sorting algorithms and illustrate their time performance with the different input arrays.
